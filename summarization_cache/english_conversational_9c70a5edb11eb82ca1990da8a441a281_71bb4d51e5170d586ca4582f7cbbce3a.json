    "summary": "Logistic regression is a variant of linear regression and probably the most basic classification algorithm. Instead of fitting a line to two numerical variables, you now try to predict a categorical output variable using categorical or numerical input variables. The K nearest neighbors algorithm, or KNN, is a very simple and intuitive algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification.",
